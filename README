This is vide 0.5.2, which can be build, but it is not fully functional as
some crude changes were applied to allow building it without GNOME
environment and without libzvt.

There is a theoretical possibility that vifm someday might have support for
a GUI frontend, in which case vide can serve as a prototype.


The help menu lists all of the commands used in vide.  :h [Enter] or [Alt] h 
will activate the help memu.
