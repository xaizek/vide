The Gnome requirement should be removed.  The only Gnome libraries that are 
used by Vide are the zvt terminal and gdk_imlib.  Everything else is written 
in Gtk+.  Gdk_imlib is already available as an addition to Gtk+ without 
requiring Gnome.  The zvt term can be separated from Gnome by writting a 
new autoconf for zvt as it only requires Gtk+ and gdk_imlib. 

The most requested feature is a ncurses based version.  This is on hold until 
the current gui is fully established and stable.
