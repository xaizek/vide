Changes 0.5 to 0.5.2
	Fixed annoying bug when using vim that would cause the clist to display
	incorrectly.

	A menu bar was added to each zvt term widget

	The notebook page can now contain more than one terminal.

	The terminals can now be detached from the notebook page.

	New keybindings for the terms.
			<alt>w  j moves down one term
			<alt>w  k moves up one term
			<alt>w  n creates a new terminal on the notebook page.
			<alt>w  m creates a new term running man + word under the cursor.
				This is similar to pressing K in vim with the added benefit of still
				being able to see the original code while reading the man page.

		When selecting a file from the term menu bar you can use your normal
		bookmarks with ' and search for files with /pattern.  You cannot use
		:commands.

	The status bar message was changed to show a brief summary of the
		selected file.  If more than one file is selected, the number of 
		selected files is shown

	:path command was changed to :pwd or :pw
		or you can just use ctrl g which will show the full path and the file
		information.

		the status bar - patch submited by Sergei Gnezdov
